The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside.The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown.The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back.The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation.The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb)</p>
